<h3>About the project</h3>
<div class="no-gutters">
<p>The idea behind this project was to create something that people use often, but <strong>not efficiently</strong>.
  With our goal in mind of focusing on sustainability, we had looked at things that people often overlook
  in everyday activities that amalgamate to be a bigger issue than someone may think on an individual basis. 
</p>
<p>People go to stores to buy items that they need, or rather that they think they need. A majority of people
  reported that they have had experiences where they have had to throw out and waste items because they had expired.
  On average, every year, this has caused approximately <strong>1.3 billion tons</strong> of solely food to be wasted every year,
  not even mentioning the amount of money being wasted in natural resources. 
</p>
<p>
  Essentially, what we had come up with is something that most people use: a grocery list. However, we looked
  to expand upon this commodity by integrating it with an <strong>automated expiration tool </strong>that displayed the time and date
  of expiration as well as sending out a reminder text when that time was near. We believed that this would greatly
  <strong>reduce the amount of waste </strong>we produce as people often forget about certain items, or don't know how long it takes
  until expiration. As well as reducing the waste, it also saves users money while helping them stay organized.
</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<div class="no-gutters">
  <p>I had first created the bare front-end of the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to function
    as a grocery list that was able to take user input of items and add them to the screen. The main 
    functionality of the application comes from the back-end. First, we webscraped data from a website called
    eatbydate.com to create a database in mySQL of various grocery items and their corresponding
    expiration dates.   
  </p>
  <img src="img/eggspired/Eggspired Catalog.png"> </img>
  <p>
    Using PHP, we connected our front-end to take user input of added grocery items
    and insert them into a separate part of our database. 
</p>
<img src="img/eggspired/Eggspired Database.png"> </img>

<p>
      When the user checks the item off of their
      list, we send a post request for that key name to find the matching value it takes until expiration. The
      time is then parsed into a date from the current time and displayed back on the bottom of the list. 
  </p>
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <video class="demo" controls muted poster="img/eggspired.png"><source src="img/eggspired/EggspiredDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
  </div><p>
      I had connected the database to an automated system where the current time is checked against the 
      expiration date. If the expiration is within a day or less, the program connects to Twilio and
      sends out a text message reminding the user of their specific item and that the expiration is near. 
    </p>

<p>
  We had found challenges coding the back end of the project as it was my first experience working
  with PHP and mySQL. We found ourselves stuck at parts where the data was not posting correctly
  as it was not properly connected to the front-end of our site. With the help of our mentor,
  we were able to move past this hurdle. Our team worked very hard to complete the project within
  the short time period allowed, and we feel very proud that we were successfully able to demo 
  our project with the functionality we wanted. 
</p>
<p>
  Future improvements we wanted to work on included a secondary page to more easily differentiate
  the grocery list from already-purchased items. Also, we hoped to implement an auto-fill search
  bar that looked for items in the database of expiration dates. Finally, we wished to upload
  the application to a server and host it for users to actually use.

        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <div class="no-gutters">
          <p>
            Masquerade Ball 2019 was a service and fundraising project hosted by UC San Diego Circle K and La 
            Jolla Kiwanis. With support from guests from all over the California-Nevada-Hawaii district,
            we aimed to raise thousands of dollars towards the Trevor Project intiative. The Trevor
            Project is a national non-profit organization dedicated towards assisting the LGTBQ youth 
            through counseling, suicide prevention hotlines, etc in order to create a stronger
            sense of a safe and inclusive space of community. 
          </p>
          <p>
          During the summer and fall of 2019, I was a member of UCSD Circle K's Masquerade Ball
          Committee with the role of webmaster. As webmaster, my responsibilties included
          retheming the previous year's website and updating the information to correspond
          to the current year's event in order to maximize viewership and increase sales. 
          Along with this, my general duties as a committee member involved the attendance of weekly
          committee meetings, volunteering stations at the event, aiding other committee members,
          and advertising the event. 
          </p>

      </section>

      <section id="function" style="padding:10%; margin-bottom:-10%">
        <h3>Redesign and Changes</h3>
        <div class="no-gutters">
            <p>
                The main design of the website that I wanted to improve on was the cleanliness of the site. I felt
                that the information could have been presented in a more organized way that was also easier on the eye.
                Also, since our demographic changed to be inclusive of older adults, I wanted to make it easier to
                navigate by having various details about the event to be spread through multiple pages, rather
                than condensed into a single about page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The main aesthetic piece that the website
                had was a scrolling animation on the main page that I changed to be representative of the
                current year's updated event theme and colors.
                Besides that, I accomplished my goals of minimalism by implementing a very simple page style that focused mainly on
                the details rather than anything extra and overwhelming. Wherever I could, I looked to provide the site
                with colors that matched the elegant theme of gold and white.
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked to take out or reduce bits of information that I deemed not as important as the rest, such as 
                the specific directions to the venue. 
                Rather than have the FAQ page visually contain every single question and answer directly, I implemented
                an accordion style drop down bar that reduced the length of the page while providing easier 
                access to what a specific user wanted to know about. Also, a majority of my time was dedicated
                to fixing bugs within the site, as the desktop and mobile view were greatly skewed from each other,
                many elements were not aligned with the rest, and various screen sizes didn't correctly display
                pages. 
            </p>

                Being apart of this committee helped me realize how much time and effort it takes into planning an event of this
                magnitude. I was still a beginner when I took up this project, but I was eager to learn and improve the site. 
                After months of working on it, I was able to accomplish more than I had expected, continually editing and pushing
                commits onto the repository to trial and error until I was able to get it right. 
                I gained experience utilizing Bootstrap and making elements of the site
                more aesthetically pleasing and uniform using containers and other preset style classes. I definitely feel more
                comfortable and confident in HTML and CSS thanks to this project while also improving upon my communication and teamwork skills
                by aiding the rest of my committee in planning and execute Masquerade Ball.
